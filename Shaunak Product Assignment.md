### Brief
__Webflow__ is a no-code website builder that empowers designers, web developers, and entrepreneurs to build websites with ease. I used the platform in its early days (2016) but abandoned it because the feature set was lackluster and the tool was cumbersome to use. My excitement has been renewed after "re-discovering" the tool recently after looking for a quick way to create a landing page. After using the platform for the past several months, I believe it is __best web site buildng tool on the market.__

As a part of my analysis, I will focus on Webflow's features, competitive advantage, and user base.

### The Problem + Landscape

When creating a website, one is posed with the choice of developing a site from "scratch" (HTML/CSS/JS) or using a hosted service with pre-built templates (Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace). While the former provides a greater degree of control/customizabilty, it is time/labor intensive and requires technical knowledge to build and maintain. Incumbent hosted services are often reliable and "easy to use" but lack the degree of customizability and control depending on use case.

Webflow bridges these two worlds with a best in class "drag and drop" functionality, granular styling control using CSS formatting and animations, a powerful hosted CMS, and a fleet of available integrations.

#### Comparison
To visualize this comparison, we can focus on the skill level of a user vs the available features/customizability offered by each platform. While options like Wordpress or Squarespace would benefit many novice users, Webflow comes out as a clear winner in its ability to market their offering to this same market segment in addition to advanced users & teams (B2B).

### Feature Focus 1: Webflow Designer
The web tool provided by Webflow allows users to take control of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript in a completely visual canvas. The designer cavas (shown below) translates drag and drop HTML elements like (div, containers, images) with advanced CSS modifiers. Additionally, modified elements or grouped elements can be converted to Symbols to support repeatability and consistancy. The platform also supports a "pared-down" Editor view that be used by less technical users to make basid edits to the website (text, images) without modifying an underlying formatting or functionality.

#### KPIs:
- __Project Publish Rate__: A key indicator of success for newly onboarded users is whether they "publish" their website to become public facing. When hypothesising Webflow's customer funnel, it is structured by generating customer interest, driving signups, driving engagement using the Webflow Designer, and finally getting the user to "publish" their website. The reason the publish rate is important because it validates that a user has explored the Webflow Design feature set and has decided to make the site "publicly" accessible. While a publish event is not paid, features like connecting a custom domain, using Webflow's CMS, and removing Webflow branding is contigent on signing up for a paid account. This KPIs is a good indicator for qualifying whether a user might convert to a paid tier.

- __# of Symbols/Project__: The symbols functionality is designed to empower users to create reusable components with modifiers available in the Designer Tool. If a particular project implements Symbols (an intermediate implementation feature), it is a good indicator that a user has mastered basic functionality in the tool. Simply put, an increase in Symbols indicates product mastery of the end user. This is incredibly important for a tool that primary value proposition is providing builders advanced functionality in an easy-to-use format.

### Feature Focus 2: CMS
While launching a blog in Webflow might take more upfront work than it would with a native blogging platform like WordPress, the result will likely be well worth the effort.
Because WordPress, for all of its strengths, has never really excelled in terms of user-friendliness or ease of customization.

Users are often locked into their theme’s default templates and styles. And so, customizing individual elements like post fields requires either adding third-party plugins or manually rewriting the underlying template files.

Webflow CMS, by contrast, bills itself as “the world’s first visual content management system,” allowing designers to define the structure and style of their dynamic content without messing with plugins, PHP, or databases.
This content can be hand-created, imported from a .CSV file, or added through Webflow’s CMS API.

Users can then create Collections, or reusable templates for dynamic content types. For example, a website can feature collections of blog posts, authors, clients, projects, products, categories, and so on.

It’s like having all of the upsides of using a database — without actually having to manage a database yourself!

### Product Opportunities
#### Problem 1: Codebase export feature is lacking
Webflow advertises that it translates web designs into clean, semantic code that’s ready to publish to the web or hand off to developers. While its internal hosting functionality is known to be quite performant, the ability of using its exported code is lacking. Modern web app architecture patterns value small/modular components that capture functional and visual UI elements.
#### Problem 2: Independent web application not available
